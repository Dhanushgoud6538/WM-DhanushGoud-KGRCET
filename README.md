# Smart Waste Bin Network 🚮

## Overview
This repository contains the conceptual design of an IoT-based Smart Waste Bin Monitoring and Predictive Waste Collection System. The system monitors garbage bin fill levels in real time and uses data analytics to predict future fill patterns for optimized waste collection planning.

## Objectives
- Monitor waste bin fill levels automatically
- Send alerts before bins overflow
- Use historical data to predict fill behavior
- Optimize garbage truck routes
- Enable scalability for smart city deployment

## System Architecture
The system is divided into four layers:
1. Sensing & Edge Layer
2. Communication Network
3. Cloud & Computing Platform
4. Visualization & Dashboard Layer

## Key Technologies
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- LoRa / Wi-Fi / NB-IoT
- MQTT Protocol
- Cloud Platforms (AWS IoT / Firebase / ThingsBoard)

## Predictive Analytics
Historical bin data is analyzed to calculate daily fill rates and predict when bins will reach critical levels. This enables proactive waste collection and efficient route planning.
